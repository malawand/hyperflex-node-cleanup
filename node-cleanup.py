#  This script restores the networking settings for a storage controller virtual machine on a HyperFlex ESXi host.
# The script should be used if:
#   1. ESXi was re-imaged on a 240 M5 or M4 HCS HX Node
#   2. Something or someone accidentally changed the ESXi host network settings and it needs to be restored.
################################################################################################
#   This script is used to clean up an existing HyperFlex node running ESXi.                   #
#   This script is NOT used to cleanup the cluster itself, but just the node in the cluster    #
#   If you need to clean the cluster, run the destroy cluster command on                       #
#   the CMIP and run this script on every ESXi host to properly clean it up                    #
#                                                                                              #
#   Put this script on a non-HX datastore directory under /vmfs/volumes                        #
#   Example: /vmfs/volumes/23e5b079-c8e4b237-766d-0a8c460c9dac/                                #
#   /vmfs/volumes/23e5b079-c8e4b237-766d-0a8c460c9dac/hx-clean.py                              #
#   cd /vmfs/volumes/23e5b079-c8e4b237-766d-0a8c460c9dac/                                      #
#   Run the python script: python hx-clean.py                                                  #
#                                                                                              #
#   If there are errors, read the errors and delete what this script is attempting to delete   #
#   and run the script again as many times as needed until the node is completely cleaned      #
